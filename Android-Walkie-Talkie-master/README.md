# Android-Walkie-Talkie

A bluetooth based push to talk app for Android.

## Introduction

A Walkie-talkie is a two way radio that allows communication between two or more parties. There are several accessories and devices that can become Walkie talkie. This project focuses on how to make two mobile android devices function as walkie-talkies over a bluetooth connection. Communication will take place between the devices similar to a push-to-talk application. This means that when one device is sending audio data, the other device is receiving (not transmitting) and vice-versa.
